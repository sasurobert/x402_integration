              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with the Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# x402 A2A Payment Protocol Extension

This package provides a complete implementation of the x402 payment protocol extension for A2A using an **exception-based approach** for dynamic payment requirements. 

## 🚀 Exception-Based Payment Requirements

Instead of static configuration, delegate agents throw `x402PaymentRequiredException` to request payment dynamically:

```python
from x402_a2a import x402PaymentRequiredException

# In your agent logic:
if is_premium_feature(request):
    raise x402PaymentRequiredException.for_service(
        price="$5.00",
        pay_to_address="0x123...",
        resource="/premium-feature"
    )

# Or use helper decorators:
@require_payment(price="$2.00", pay_to_address="0x456...", resource="/ai-service")
async def generate_content(prompt):
    return ai_service.generate(prompt)
```

This approach enables:
- **Dynamic pricing** based on request parameters
- **Per-service payment requirements** without configuration
- **Multiple payment options** (basic, premium, ultra tiers)
- **Clean separation** between business logic and payment logic

## 📦 Supported Payment Schemes

### MultiversX (mvx) - Relayed Transactions V3
Enables "Gasless" payments where the credentials provider pays the network fees.

```python
from x402_a2a.schemes.multiversx import MultiversXScheme
scheme = MultiversXScheme(chain_id="1") # Mainnet
```

Requirements: `pip install "x402-a2a[multiversx]"`

## Architecture Overview

The package follows a "functional core, imperative shell" architecture. The core protocol is implementation-agnostic and can be used independently, while executors provide optional middleware for common integration patterns.

## 1. Core Protocol Architecture

The x402 extension separates **protocol requirements** from **implementation patterns**:

### 1.1. Package Structure

## 2. Core Protocol Requirements

### 2.1. Required Data Structures

The x402_a2a package leverages core types from the `x402.types` package and extends them with A2A-specific structures.

#### **From `x402.types` (Core x402 Protocol)**

These types are imported directly from the x402 protocol package:

```python
from x402.types import (
    PaymentRequirements,           # Core payment requirements structure
    x402PaymentRequiredResponse,   # Payment required response from merchant
    PaymentPayload,               # Signed payment authorization
    VerifyResponse,               # Payment verification result  
    SettleResponse               # Payment settlement result
)
```

**`PaymentRequirements`** - Describes payment options:
- `scheme: str` - Payment scheme (e.g., "exact")
- `network: SupportedNetworks` - Blockchain network 
- `asset: str` - Token contract address
- `pay_to: str` - Recipient wallet address
- `max_amount_required: str` - Payment amount in atomic units
- `resource: str` - Resource identifier
- `description: str` - Human-readable description
- `max_timeout_seconds: int` - Payment validity timeout
- `mime_type: str` - Expected response content type
- `output_schema: Optional[Any]` - Response schema
- `extra: Optional[dict]` - Scheme-specific additional data

**`x402PaymentRequiredResponse`** - Initial payment request:
- `x402_version: int` - Protocol version (1)
- `accepts: list[PaymentRequirements]` - Array of payment options
- `error: str` - Error message if applicable

**`PaymentPayload`** - Signed payment authorization:
- `x402_version: int` - Protocol version
- `scheme: str` - Payment scheme used
- `network: str` - Blockchain network
- `payload: SchemePayloads` - Scheme-specific signed data (e.g., `ExactPaymentPayload`)

#### **New to `x402_a2a.types` (A2A Extension)**

These types are specific to the A2A protocol extension:

```python
from x402_a2a.types import (
    PaymentStatus,        # A2A payment state enum
    x402MessageType,      # A2A message type enum
    x402Metadata,         # A2A metadata key constants
    x402ServerConfig      # Server payment configuration
)
```

**`PaymentStatus`** - A2A payment state enumeration:
```python
class PaymentStatus(str, Enum):
    """Protocol-defined payment states for A2A flow"""
    PAYMENT_REQUIRED = "payment-required"    # Payment requested
    PAYMENT_SUBMITTED = "payment-submitted"  # Payment signed and submitted
    PAYMENT_VERIFIED = "payment-verified"    # Payment has been verified by facilitator
    PAYMENT_REJECTED = "payment-rejected"    # Payment requirements rejected by client
    PAYMENT_COMPLETED = "payment-completed"  # Payment settled successfully
    PAYMENT_FAILED = "payment-failed"        # Payment processing failed
```

**`x402MessageType`** - Message type constants (x402_a2a.types.messages):
```python  
class x402MessageType(str, Enum):
    """Message type identifiers for A2A x402 flow"""
    PAYMENT_REQUIRED = "x402.payment.required"      # Initial payment request
    PAYMENT_PAYLOAD = "x402.payment.payload"        # Signed payment submission
    PAYMENT_SETTLED = "x402.payment.settled"        # Settlement completion
```

**`x402ServerConfig`** - Server payment configuration (x402_a2a.types.config):
```python
class x402ServerConfig(BaseModel):
    """Configuration for how a server expects to be paid"""
    price: Union[str, int, TokenAmount]        # Payment price (Money or TokenAmount)
    pay_to_address: str                        # Ethereum address to receive payment
    network: str = "base"                      # Blockchain network
    description: str = "Payment required..."   # Human-readable description
    mime_type: str = "application/json"        # Expected response type
    max_timeout_seconds: int = 600             # Payment validity timeout
    resource: Optional[str] = None             # Resource identifier (e.g., '/api/generate')
    asset_address: Optional[str] = None        # Token contract (auto-derived for USDC if None)
```

### 2.3. Required Metadata Keys

Implementations MUST use these exact metadata keys in Task and Message objects:

```python
class x402Metadata:
    """Spec-defined metadata key constants (x402_a2a.types.state)"""
    STATUS_KEY = "x402.payment.status"
    REQUIRED_KEY = "x402.payment.required"      # Contains x402PaymentRequiredResponse
    PAYLOAD_KEY = "x402.payment.payload"        # Contains PaymentPayload
    RECEIPTS_KEY = "x402.payment.receipts"      # Contains array of SettleResponse objects
    ERROR_KEY = "x402.payment.error"            # Error code (when failed)
```

### 2.4. Extension Declaration & Activation

```python
# Extension URI constant
X402_EXTENSION_URI = "https://github.com/google-a2a/a2a-x402/v0.1"

    def get_extension_declaration(
    description: str = "Supports x402 payments", 
        required: bool = True
) -> dict:
        """Creates extension declaration for AgentCard."""
    return {
        "uri": X402_EXTENSION_URI,
        "description": description,
        "required": required
    }

def check_extension_activation(request_headers: dict) -> bool:
    """Check if x402 extension is activated via HTTP headers."""
    extensions = request_headers.get("X-A2A-Extensions", "")
    return X402_EXTENSION_URI in extensions

def add_extension_activation_header(response_headers: dict) -> dict:
    """Echo extension URI in response header to confirm activation."""
    response_headers["X-A2A-Extensions"] = X402_EXTENSION_URI
    return response_headers
```

### 2.5. Task Correlation Mechanism

```python
def create_payment_submission_message(
    task_id: str,  # CRITICAL: Original task ID for correlation
    payment_payload: PaymentPayload,
    text: str = "Payment authorization provided",
    message_id: Optional[str] = None  # Optional specific message ID
) -> Message:
    """Creates correlated payment submission message per spec."""
    return Message(
        task_id=task_id,  # Spec mandates this correlation
        role="user", 
        parts=[{"kind": "text", "text": text}],
        metadata={
            x402Metadata.STATUS_KEY: PaymentStatus.PAYMENT_SUBMITTED.value,
            x402Metadata.PAYLOAD_KEY: payment_payload.model_dump(by_alias=True)
        }
    )

def extract_task_id(message: Message) -> Optional[str]:
    """Extracts task ID for correlation from payment message."""
    return getattr(message, 'task_id', None)
```

## 3. Architecture Role Mapping

The spec defines communication between Client Agent and Merchant Agent. The roles below show **recommended patterns** for organizing payment functionality. These are **architectural examples** showing how different systems might handle their responsibilities - they are not code classes that will be imported from the package:

### 3.1. Client Agent Role
*Example architectural pattern - represents a separate system/service*

```python
class ClientAgentOperations:
    """Example: How a Client Agent system might organize payment orchestration."""
    
    @staticmethod
    async def relay_to_signing_service(
        payment_required: x402PaymentRequiredResponse,
        signing_service: SigningService
    ) -> PaymentPayload:
        """Forward payment requirements to signing service for authorization."""
        # Signing service receives entire x402PaymentRequiredResponse
        # Returns complete PaymentPayload with selected requirement and signature
        return await signing_service.process_payment_required(payment_required)
    
    @staticmethod
    async def submit_payment_to_merchant(
        task_id: str,
        payment_payload: PaymentPayload,
        merchant_agent: MerchantAgent
    ) -> Task:
        """Submit signed payment authorization back to merchant with task correlation."""
        message = create_payment_submission_message(task_id, payment_payload)
        return await merchant_agent.process_payment(message)
```

### 3.2. Merchant Agent Role
*Example architectural pattern - represents a separate system/service*

```python
class MerchantAgentOperations:
    """Example: How a Merchant Agent system might handle payment processing."""
    
    @staticmethod
    def create_payment_request(
        config: PaymentRequirementsConfig
    ) -> Tuple[Task, x402PaymentRequiredResponse]:
        """Create payment requirements and task when payment is needed for a service."""
        requirements = create_payment_requirements(config)
        payment_required = x402PaymentRequiredResponse(
            x402_version=1,
            accepts=[requirements]
        )
        
        task = Task(
            id=generate_task_id(),
            status=TaskStatus(state=TaskState.input_required),
            metadata={
                x402Metadata.STATUS_KEY: PaymentStatus.PAYMENT_REQUIRED,
                x402Metadata.REQUIRED_KEY: payment_required.model_dump(by_alias=True)
            }
        )
        
        return task, payment_required
    
    @staticmethod
    async def process_settlement(
        payment_payload: PaymentPayload,
        payment_requirements: PaymentRequirements,
        facilitator_config: FacilitatorConfig
    ) -> SettleResponse:
        """Verify and settle payment after receiving signed authorization."""
        # Verify payment signature and requirements with facilitator
        verification = await verify_payment(payment_payload, payment_requirements, facilitator_config)
        if not verification.is_valid:
            return SettleResponse(
                success=False,
                network=payment_requirements.network,
                error_reason=verification.invalid_reason
            )
        
        # Settle payment on blockchain via facilitator
        return await settle_payment(payment_payload, payment_requirements, facilitator_config)
```

### 3.3. Signing Service Role (Recommended Architecture)
*Example architectural pattern - can be separate system or integrated with Client*

The spec defines communication between Client Agent and Merchant Agent. The signing service is a **recommended architectural pattern** for security and domain separation, but the spec does not mandate how signing is implemented.

**Architectural Options:**

1. **Separate Signing Service (Recommended)**:
   - Client Agent communicates with independent signing service
   - Clear security boundary and domain separation  
   - Signing service can be server-side, hardware wallet, MPC, etc.

2. **Integrated Signing (Spec Compliant)**:
   - Client Agent includes signing capabilities directly
   - Still meets spec requirements for communication flow
   - Implementation choice based on security model

```python
class SigningServiceOperations:
    """Example: How a Signing Service might be structured (not actual importable code)."""
    
    def __init__(self, account: Account):
        self._account = account  # Implementation detail - could be HSM, MPC, etc.
        
    async def process_payment_required(
        self,
        payment_required: x402PaymentRequiredResponse,
        max_value: Optional[int] = None
    ) -> PaymentPayload:
        """Process payment requirements: select, sign, and return payment payload."""
        # Select appropriate payment requirement from available options
        selected_requirement = self._select_payment_requirement(payment_required.accepts)
        
        # Sign the selected requirement using private key
        payment_payload = await process_payment(selected_requirement, self._account, max_value)
        
        # Return signed payment payload ready for merchant submission
        return payment_payload
    
    def _select_payment_requirement(
        self, 
        accepts: list[PaymentRequirements]
    ) -> PaymentRequirements:
        """Payment selection logic - customize based on implementation needs."""
        return accepts[0]  # Simple default - can be enhanced
```

### 3.4. Facilitator Role
*Example architectural pattern - represents a separate blockchain/settlement service*

```python
class FacilitatorOperations:
    """Example: How a Facilitator service might handle on-chain operations."""
    
    @staticmethod
    async def verify_payment_payload(
        payment_payload: PaymentPayload,
        payment_requirements: PaymentRequirements
    ) -> VerificationResult:
        """Verify payment signature and requirements before processing."""
        return await verify_payment(payment_payload, payment_requirements)
    
    @staticmethod
    async def settle_on_chain(
        payment_payload: PaymentPayload,
        payment_requirements: PaymentRequirements
    ) -> SettleResponse:
        """Post payment transaction to blockchain after successful verification."""
        return await settle_payment(payment_payload, payment_requirements)
```

## 4. Core Protocol Implementation

The `/core` module provides implementation-agnostic functions for the protocol operations:

### 4.1. Core Function Interface

Functions implemented in `x402_a2a.core`:

```python
# Payment Requirements Creation (x402_a2a.core.merchant)

    mime_type: str = "application/json",
    scheme: str = "exact",
    max_timeout_seconds: int = 600,
    output_schema: Optional[Any] = None,
    **kwargs
) -> PaymentRequirements:
    """Creates PaymentRequirements object using x402's price processing."""

# Payment Processing (x402_a2a.core.wallet)  
def process_payment_required(
    payment_required: x402PaymentRequiredResponse,

) -> PaymentPayload:
    """Process full payment required response - uses x402.clients.base.x402Client.
    
    Returns signed PaymentPayload with selected requirement.
    """

def process_payment(
    requirements: PaymentRequirements,
    account: Account,
    max_value: Optional[int] = None
) -> PaymentPayload:
    """Create PaymentPayload - extends x402.clients.base.x402Client.create_payment_header.
    
    Same as create_payment_header but returns PaymentPayload object (not base64 encoded).
    """

# Payment Verification (x402_a2a.core.protocol)
def verify_payment(
    payment_payload: PaymentPayload,
    payment_requirements: PaymentRequirements,
    facilitator_client: Optional[FacilitatorClient] = None
) -> VerifyResponse:
    """Verify payment - calls facilitator_client.verify()."""

    payment_requirements: PaymentRequirements,
    facilitator_client: Optional[FacilitatorClient] = None

```

```

## 5. Security Considerations

The spec defines **protocol-level security requirements** that implementations MUST follow, but does not prescribe specific implementation details:

### 5.1. Implementation Flexibility

The signing service architecture is **recommended** for security and domain separation, but the spec technically only defines communication between Client Agent and Merchant Agent. Implementations can:

- Use separate signing services (recommended)
- Integrate signing into the host agent (spec compliant)  
- Choose any appropriate communication method between host and signing service
- Implement security measures appropriate for their deployment model

### 5.2. Error Code Mapping

```python
class x402ErrorCode:
    """Standard error codes from spec Section 8.1."""
    INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS = "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS"
    INVALID_SIGNATURE = "INVALID_SIGNATURE"
    EXPIRED_PAYMENT = "EXPIRED_PAYMENT"
    DUPLICATE_NONCE = "DUPLICATE_NONCE"
    NETWORK_MISMATCH = "NETWORK_MISMATCH"
    INVALID_AMOUNT = "INVALID_AMOUNT"
    SETTLEMENT_FAILED = "SETTLEMENT_FAILED"

def map_error_to_code(error: Exception) -> str:
    """Maps implementation errors to spec error codes."""
    error_mapping = {
        ValidationError: x402ErrorCode.INVALID_SIGNATURE,
        PaymentError: x402ErrorCode.SETTLEMENT_FAILED,
        # Add more mappings as needed
    }
    return error_mapping.get(type(error), "UNKNOWN_ERROR")
```

## 6. Complete Protocol Flow

This section describes the end-to-end payment flow between separate systems communicating via A2A protocol. Each step involves network communication between independent services.

### 6.1. Payment Flow Overview

The x402 payment flow involves **four separate systems**:
- **Client Agent**: Orchestrates payment on behalf of user/client
- **Merchant Agent**: Provides paid services, handles settlement
- **Signing Service**: Handles payment authorization (can be separate or integrated with Client)
- **Facilitator**: Verifies and settles payments on-chain

### 6.2. Step-by-Step Protocol Flow

#### **Steps 1-2: Service Request & Payment Requirements**

**Client Agent → Merchant Agent**
- Client sends A2A service request message
- Merchant determines payment is required for this service

**Merchant Agent → Client Agent**
- Merchant responds with `Task` (state: `input-required`)
- Task metadata contains `x402.payment.status: "payment-required"`
- Task metadata contains `x402.payment.required` with `x402PaymentRequiredResponse`
- Response includes array of acceptable payment methods (`accepts[]`)

#### **Steps 3-4: Payment Authorization**

**Client Agent → Signing Service**
- Client extracts `x402PaymentRequiredResponse` from task metadata
- Client forwards entire payment required response to signing service
- Communication method depends on implementation (HTTP, gRPC, local call, etc.)

**Signing Service Internal Process:**
- Receives full `x402PaymentRequiredResponse` 
- Selects appropriate payment method from `accepts[]` array
- Signs the selected payment requirement
- Creates `PaymentPayload` with signature

**Signing Service → Client Agent**
- Returns signed `PaymentPayload` for the selected payment requirements
- PaymentPayload contains all necessary signature and payment data

#### **Step 5: Payment Submission**

**Client Agent → Merchant Agent**
- Client sends A2A `Message` with payment authorization
- Message **MUST** include `taskId` for correlation with original request
- Message metadata contains `x402.payment.status: "payment-submitted"`
- Message metadata contains `x402.payment.payload` with the signed `PaymentPayload`

#### **Steps 6-7: Payment Verification**

**Merchant Agent Internal Process:**
- Receives payment submission message
- Correlates payment with original service request using `taskId`
- Updates task state to `working`
- Updates task metadata: `x402.payment.status: "payment-pending"`

**Merchant Agent → Facilitator**
- Merchant forwards payment for verification
- Sends `PaymentRequirements` and `PaymentPayload` to facilitator
- Communication method is implementation-specific

**Facilitator → Merchant Agent**
- Returns verification status
- If invalid, includes reason for rejection

#### **Steps 8-9: Settlement & Completion**

**If Verification Successful:**

**Merchant Agent → Facilitator**
- Requests payment settlement on blockchain
- Facilitator posts transaction to appropriate network

**Facilitator → Merchant Agent**
- Returns settlement result with transaction hash

**Merchant Agent Final Response:**
- Updates task state to `completed` (success) or `failed` (error)
- Updates task metadata: `x402.payment.status: "payment-completed"` or `"payment-failed"`
- Adds `x402.payment.receipt` with settlement details (`SettleResponse`)
- Includes service result as task `artifacts` (if successful)

**Merchant Agent → Client Agent**
- Returns final `Task` with completion status and results

### 6.3. Error Handling Flow

At any step, if an error occurs:

1. **Payment Verification Fails (Step 6)**:
   - Merchant updates task state to `failed`
   - Metadata: `x402.payment.status: "payment-failed"`
   - Metadata: `x402.payment.error` with appropriate error code
   - Returns error response to Client

2. **Settlement Fails (Step 8)**:
   - Same error handling as verification failure
   - May include partial transaction information

3. **Network/Communication Failures**:
   - Standard A2A error handling applies
   - Timeout and retry policies per implementation

### 6.4. Implementation Considerations

- **All communications** use A2A protocol message format
- **Task correlation** via `taskId` is critical for payment tracking
- **State management** happens independently in each system
- **Network boundaries** exist between all components
- **Security** relies on proper message validation and transport security
- **Facilitator integration** method varies by implementation (API calls, blockchain direct, etc.)

## 7. Core Usage (Direct Implementation)

Developers can use the core functions directly without executors:

### 7.1. Merchant Implementation

```python
# Core x402 Protocol Types
from x402.types import PaymentRequirements, x402PaymentRequiredResponse

# A2A Extension Functions & Types
from x402_a2a import (
    create_payment_requirements,
    settle_payment,
    x402Utils,
    x402Metadata,
    x402ErrorCode
)
from x402.facilitator import FacilitatorClient

utils = x402Utils()

# Handle payment request
async def handle_payment_request(task: Task, price: str, resource: str):
    # Create requirements
    requirements = create_payment_requirements(
        price=price,  # Can be "$1.00", 1.00, or TokenAmount
        pay_to_address="0x...",  # Merchant's address
        resource=resource,
        network="base",
        description="Service payment"
    )
    
    # Create payment required response
    payment_required = x402PaymentRequiredResponse(
        x402_version=1,
        accepts=[requirements]
    )
    
    # Update task state
    task = utils.create_payment_required_task(task, payment_required)
    return task

# Handle payment submission
async def handle_payment_submission(task: Task, payment_requirements: PaymentRequirements):
    # Get payment payload from task using utility method
    payment_payload = utils.get_payment_payload(task)
    
    # Verify payment first
    facilitator_client = FacilitatorClient({"url": "https://x402.org/facilitator"})
    verify_response = await facilitator_client.verify(
        payment_payload, 
        payment_requirements
    )
    
    if not verify_response.is_valid:
        task = utils.record_payment_failure(
            task, "verification_failed", 
            SettleResponse(success=False, network="base", error_reason=verify_response.invalid_reason)
        )
        return task
    
    # Settle payment after verification
    settle_response = await facilitator_client.settle(
        payment_payload,
        payment_requirements
    )
    
    # Use SettleResponse directly from x402
    settle_response_result = SettleResponse(
        success=settle_response.success,
        transaction=settle_response.transaction,
        network=settle_response.network or "base",
        payer=settle_response.payer,
        error_reason=settle_response.error_reason
    )
    
    # Update task state based on result
    if settle_response.success:
        task = utils.record_payment_success(task, settle_response_result)
    else:
        task = utils.record_payment_failure(task, "settlement_failed", settle_response_result)
    
    return task
```

### 7.2. Wallet Implementation

```python
# Core x402 Protocol Types
from x402.types import PaymentRequirements, x402PaymentRequiredResponse

# A2A Extension Functions & Types  
from x402_a2a import (
    process_payment_required,
    x402Utils,
    x402Metadata
)
from eth_account import Account

# Handle payment requirements
async def handle_payment_requirements(task: Task, account: Account):
    # Get requirements from task metadata
    utils = x402Utils()
    payment_required = utils.get_payment_requirements(task)
    
    # Use x402Client for payment selection and signing
    from x402.clients.base import x402Client
    client = x402Client(account=account, max_value=100)
    
    # Select payment requirement from accepts array
    selected_requirement = client.select_payment_requirements(payment_required.accepts)
    
    # Create payment payload (like create_payment_header but returns PaymentPayload)
    payment_payload = await process_payment(selected_requirement, account)
    
    # Update task state
    task = utils.record_payment_submission(task, payment_payload)
    return task
```

## 8. Optional Executor Middleware

The `/executors` module provides optional middleware for common integration patterns. **These are convenience wrappers and are not required** if you implement the core functions directly.

### 8.1. Server Executor (Exception-Based)

```python
class x402ServerExecutor(x402BaseExecutor):
    """Server-side middleware with exception-based payment requirements."""
    
    def __init__(
        self, 
        delegate: AgentExecutor, 
        config: x402ExtensionConfig,
        facilitator_client: Optional[FacilitatorClient] = None
    ):
        """No server configuration needed - payments defined via exceptions."""
        super().__init__(delegate, config)
        self.facilitator_client = facilitator_client or FacilitatorClient()
    
    async def execute(self, context: RequestContext, event_queue: EventQueue):
        if not self.is_active(context):
            try:
                return await self._delegate.execute(context, event_queue)
            except x402PaymentRequiredException as e:
                # Handle payment requirements from exceptions
                await self._handle_payment_required_exception(e, context, event_queue)
                return

        task = context.current_task
        status = self.utils.get_payment_status(task)

        if status == PaymentStatus.PAYMENT_SUBMITTED:
            # Verify → Process → Settle pattern
            payment_payload = self.utils.get_payment_payload(task)
            payment_requirements = self._extract_payment_requirements_from_context(task)
            
            verify_response = await self.facilitator_client.verify(
                payment_payload, payment_requirements
            )
            
            if not verify_response.is_valid:
                # Handle verification failure
                await self._fail_payment(task, "verification_failed", verify_response.invalid_reason, event_queue)
            else:
                # Process request with delegate
                await self._delegate.execute(context, event_queue)
                
                # Settle if successful
                settle_response = await self.facilitator_client.settle(
                    payment_payload, payment_requirements
                )
                
                if settle_response.success:
                    task = self.utils.record_payment_success(task, settle_response)
                else:
                    task = self.utils.record_payment_failure(task, "settlement_failed", settle_response)
                
                await event_queue.enqueue_event(task)
            return

        # Normal business logic - catches payment exceptions
        try:
            return await self._delegate.execute(context, event_queue)
        except x402PaymentRequiredException as e:
            # Delegate threw payment exception - create payment requirements
            await self._handle_payment_required_exception(e, context, event_queue)
            return
```

### 8.2. Client Executor (Optional)

```python
class x402ClientExecutor(x402BaseExecutor):
    """Client-side middleware - uses x402Client for payment logic."""
    
    def __init__(self, delegate: AgentExecutor, config: x402ExtensionConfig, account: Account, max_value: Optional[int] = None):
        super().__init__(delegate, config)
        from x402.clients.base import x402Client
        self.x402_client = x402Client(account=account, max_value=max_value)
        self.account = account
    
    async def execute(self, context: RequestContext, event_queue: EventQueue):
        if not self.is_active(context):
            return await self._delegate.execute(context, event_queue)

        task = context.current_task
        payment_required = self.utils.get_payment_requirements(task)
        
        if payment_required:
            
            # Use x402Client for selection (reuses existing logic)
            selected_requirement = self.x402_client.select_payment_requirements(payment_required.accepts)
            
            # Create payment payload (extends x402Client.create_payment_header)
            payment_payload = await process_payment(selected_requirement, self.account)
            
            task = self.utils.record_payment_submission(task, payment_payload)
            await event_queue.enqueue_event(task)
            return

        return await self._delegate.execute(context, event_queue)
```

## 9. State Transitions

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> PAYMENT_REQUIRED: create_payment_request()
    PAYMENT_REQUIRED --> PAYMENT_REJECTED: client rejects payment
    PAYMENT_REQUIRED --> PAYMENT_SUBMITTED: record_payment_submission()
    PAYMENT_SUBMITTED --> PAYMENT_VERIFIED: verify_payment()
    PAYMENT_VERIFIED --> PAYMENT_COMPLETED: settle_payment() succeeds
    PAYMENT_VERIFIED --> PAYMENT_FAILED: settle_payment() fails
    PAYMENT_REJECTED --> [*]
    PAYMENT_FAILED --> [*]
    PAYMENT_COMPLETED --> [*]
```

## 10. Integration Patterns

### 10.1. Direct Core Usage (Recommended)

Use core functions directly for maximum control and minimal dependencies:

```python
# Core x402 Protocol Types
from x402.types import (
    PaymentRequirements,
    x402PaymentRequiredResponse,
    PaymentPayload,
    VerifyResponse,
    SettleResponse
)

# A2A Extension Types & Functions
from x402_a2a import (
    # Core Functions
    create_payment_requirements,
    settle_payment,
    process_payment_required,    # Recommended approach
    process_payment,             # Individual signing
    verify_payment,
    
    # A2A-Specific Types
    PaymentStatus,
    x402Metadata,
    
    # Utilities
    x402Utils,
    X402_EXTENSION_URI,
    x402ErrorCode,
    create_payment_submission_message
)
from x402.facilitator import FacilitatorClient

# Implement your own integration logic using core functions
```

### 10.2. Executor Middleware (Exception-Based)

Use executors for automatic payment handling with exceptions:

```python
# Server-side middleware
from x402_a2a.executors import x402ServerExecutor
from x402_a2a import (
    x402ExtensionConfig,
    X402_EXTENSION_URI,
    x402PaymentRequiredException
)
from x402.facilitator import FacilitatorClient
from eth_account import Account

# Wrap your existing executors (no configuration needed)
server_executor = x402ServerExecutor(
    delegate=your_executor, 
    config=config
)

# In your delegate agent, throw exceptions for payment:
class MyAgent:
    async def execute(self, context, event_queue):
        if is_premium_feature(context):
            raise x402PaymentRequiredException.for_service(
                price="$5.00",
                pay_to_address="0xmerchant123",
                resource="/premium-feature"
            )
        # Regular logic continues...
```

## 11. Error Handling

The core protocol defines standard error codes that implementations MUST support:

```python
class x402ErrorCode:
    """Standard error codes from spec Section 8.1."""
    INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS = "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS"
    INVALID_SIGNATURE = "INVALID_SIGNATURE" 
    EXPIRED_PAYMENT = "EXPIRED_PAYMENT"
    DUPLICATE_NONCE = "DUPLICATE_NONCE"
    NETWORK_MISMATCH = "NETWORK_MISMATCH"
    INVALID_AMOUNT = "INVALID_AMOUNT"
    SETTLEMENT_FAILED = "SETTLEMENT_FAILED"
    
    @classmethod
    def get_all_codes(cls) -> list[str]:
        """Returns all defined error codes."""
        return [
            cls.INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS,
            cls.INVALID_SIGNATURE,
            cls.EXPIRED_PAYMENT,
            cls.DUPLICATE_NONCE,
            cls.NETWORK_MISMATCH,
            cls.INVALID_AMOUNT,
            cls.SETTLEMENT_FAILED
        ]
```

## 12. Package Exports

The package exports both core functionality and optional convenience middleware:

```python
