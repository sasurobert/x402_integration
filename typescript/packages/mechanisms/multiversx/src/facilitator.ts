    // Stub for future methods
    // In TS integration, Facilitator logic often resides in the backend (Go/Python) or Node.js server.
    // If this package is for the browser client, it might not need full Facilitator logic.
    // However, x402 TS SDK often includes 'mechanisms' that provide client-side support.

    // Check if we need to implement specific interface from @x402/typescript?
    // Usually 'Scheme' interface.
